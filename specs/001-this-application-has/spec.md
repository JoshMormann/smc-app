# Feature Specification: SREF Code Copy to Clipboard

**Feature Branch**: `001-this-application-has`  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "This application has already been bootstrapped to include a number of primary features, such as basic navigation, UI, and authentication is set up with Supabase and it is working, but we have a number of features left to create. The first of which that I would like to specify is the ability to copy a code to the clipboard from an sref card component by simply clicking on it as an authenticated user"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: Copy SREF codes to clipboard via click interaction
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: authenticated users
   ‚Üí Actions: click on SREF card, copy code to clipboard
   ‚Üí Data: SREF codes from cards
   ‚Üí Constraints: user must be authenticated
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should this work for all SREF card types or specific ones?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should there be visual feedback when copy succeeds/fails?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: authenticated user clicks card ‚Üí code copied
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Copy functionality, authentication check, user feedback
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí SREF codes, authenticated users, clipboard
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties around feedback and card types"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
An authenticated user browsing SREF cards wants to quickly copy a code for use elsewhere (social media, design tools, etc.). They should be able to click directly on any SREF card to instantly copy its code to their clipboard, making it easy to share or reference the style.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an authenticated user is viewing SREF cards, **When** they click on any card, **Then** the SREF code is copied to their clipboard
2. **Given** an unauthenticated user is viewing SREF cards, **When** they click on any card, **Then** the copy action should not execute and they should be prompted to authenticate
3. **Given** an authenticated user successfully copies a code, **When** the copy operation completes, **Then** they should receive visual confirmation that the copy was successful

### Edge Cases
- What happens when clipboard access is denied by the browser?
- How does the system handle network failures during authentication check?
- What happens if the SREF code data is missing or malformed?
- Should copy work when user is viewing cards but loses authentication mid-session?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST only allow authenticated users to copy SREF codes to clipboard
- **FR-002**: System MUST copy the complete SREF code when a user clicks on an SREF card
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide visual feedback when copy operation succeeds [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What type of feedback - toast, animation, status indicator?]
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle copy operation failures gracefully [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How should failures be communicated to users?]
- **FR-005**: System MUST work with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: all SREF card types or specific card components?]
- **FR-006**: System MUST verify user authentication before allowing copy operation
- **FR-007**: System MUST preserve existing card click behaviors [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Are there existing click handlers that should be maintained?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **SREF Code**: The text-based code identifier that users want to copy (e.g., "--sref 1234567890")
- **Authenticated User**: User with valid authentication session who can perform copy operations
- **SREF Card**: UI component displaying SREF information with clickable copy functionality
- **Clipboard**: System clipboard where copied codes are stored for user access
